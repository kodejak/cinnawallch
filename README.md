Cinnamon Wallpaper Changer

This is a simple Python script to change the cinnamon wallpaper from a defined wallpaper directory periodically.

Constants:
- wall_allowed: Array with allowed image extensions
- wall_dir: path to wallpaper directory
- sleeptime: change period in minutes

Tested under Fedora 19 / Cinnamon 18.

Have fun.
